# Laravel + React JSX Starter Kit  

## 🚀 Introduction  

This is a **JSX-based** version of the Laravel React Starter Kit. It provides a **modern** and **minimalist** setup for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using **[Inertia](https://inertiajs.com)**.  

Unlike the original version, this kit **removes TypeScript** and uses plain JavaScript (`.jsx` instead of `.tsx`), making it easier for developers who prefer **JavaScript over TypeScript**.  

This kit includes **React 19, JavaScript, TailwindCSS 4, and modern UI libraries like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com)** to help you build fast and beautiful applications.



## 🎯 Features  

✅ **React 19 + JSX** – No TypeScript, just JavaScript  
✅ **Laravel 12** – Backend power with the latest Laravel features  
✅ **Inertia 2** – Seamless single-page app experience  
✅ **TailwindCSS 4 + ShadCN** – Modern UI components  
✅ **Vite** – Super-fast development with hot module replacement  
✅ **Testing Support** – PHPUnit & Pest included  
✅ **Zero Configuration Required** – Just install and start coding!
